=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Log::Any::Adapter->set(
        'Multiplex',
        adapters_and_args => {
            'Stdout' => [],
            'Stderr' => [ log_level => 'warn' ],
            ...
            $adapter => \@adapter_args
        },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This built-in L<Log::Any> adapter provides a simple means of routing logs to
multiple other L<Log::Any::Adapter>s.

Adapters receiving messages from this adapter can behave just like they are the
only recipient of the log message. That means they can, for example, use
L<Log::Any::Adapter::Development/Structured logging> (or not).

C<adapters_and_args> is a hashref whose keys should be adapters, and whose
values are the arguments to pass those adapters on initialization.

Note that this differs from other loggers like L<Log::Dispatch>, which will
only provide its output modules a single string C<$message>, and not the full
L<Log::Any/Log context data>.
